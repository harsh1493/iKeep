# ![Logo](./documents/logo.png) A Clone of Google Keep

A minimal *Clone* of [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with [Material UI Components](https://material-ui.com/), themed to look exactly like *Google Keep*, with complex features like sharing, archiving, reminders etc. shoved away. The backend is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server written in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), with data persisted in [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/). The server implementation is complete with *Jason Web Token  based Authentication*, implemented using [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken).

## Design


This diagram explains the high-level architecture design of this project. This stack is a *MERN*, with frontend-backend-database all packed into one single *container* deployment. Frontend is a *ReactJS* stack. 

The **Frontend** is built with *ReactJS* using *Material UI React* components. The state management is through *React's Hooks for State, Context & Reducer* (see [`store.js`](web/src/store.js)). The main application is available at root `/`, which on load tries to load the noteitems. 

Since the user will not authenticated by this time, the *Router* navigates the user to `/login` where the user can enter `email` & `password` to login. To register for a new user, the user clicks on the 'Register' link to navigate to `/register` route. The user may enter any `name`, `email` (no email verification in place) and `password`. All Login & Registration HTTP calls are REST and are made via *Axios* React *Hooks* API.

Once logged in, a session cookie will be set in the browser. Now, the *GraphQL* API is available at `/query` and *URQL* client loads all the *Notes*, *Labels* & *User* information, in a single *query* (However, has to be optimised, as URQL's caching mechanism, makes involuntary calls, whenever any of the *mutation* happens). UI displays the items. User may create, update, delete *note* items, and may also create & assign/unassign labels to note items. The *labels* may be added, but update/delete hasn't be implemented now. User can sign out, by clicking the 'Profile' icon and then 'Sign Out' button.

The **Backend** is built with *Nodejs* and no server framework is used, except *Express.js*. 

The DB is a *MongoDB*, *mongoose* allows quick and easy Database modelling.


## How to Setup and Run

### Method 1: Docker

1) Clone the Git repository

```sh
git clonehttps://github.com/harsh1493/iKeep.git
```

2) CD into the folder

```sh
cd IKeep
```

3) Install dependencies for both frontend and backend

```sh
npm i
cd backend
npm i
cd ..
```

4) run both server and react app using both.js script defined in package.json

```sh
npm run both
```

5) Launches https://localhost:3000 in the browser
